# xCam-RPI
Software for viewing multiple IP camera streams on RPI using only console.

1. Configuration is available in main file. It's simplified as much as it can be. Just set your resolution and You're good to go. However, auto detection script may not find proper max ABS_X and ABS_Y for touch screen, then it is needed to put it manually in the config.

2. Based on cameras count, software will automatically arrange videos on the screen.

3. It's prepared for touch screens, so when You click one of the streams, it will automatically go full screen.

4. If You don't have touch screen, run it with --notouch parameter.

5. Zooming camera after touch may take 2-3 seconds, that's normal, nothing to worry about.

6. Have fun!

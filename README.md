# xCam-RPI
Software for viewing multiple IP camera streams on RPI using only console.

Configuration is available in main file. It's simplified as much as it can be. Just set your resolution and You're good to go. However, auto detection script may not find proper max ABS_X and ABS_Y for touch screen, then it is needed to put it manually in the config.

Based on cameras count, software will automatically arrange videos on the screen.

It's prepared for touch screens, so when You click one of the streams, it will automatically go full screen.

There is still some problem with starting full screen video from time to time. Will be fixed in near future.
